                    Butterflies often have brightly coloured wings with unique patterns made up of tiny scales. 
                    Most butterflies feed on nectar from flowers. 
                    Butterflies have taste receptors on their feet. 
                    Scientists estimate that there are between 15000 and 20000 different species of butterfly.

                    Rabbits practice a cute behavior know as "binky". 
                    They jump up in the air and twist and spin around! 
                   Rabbits are herbivores and eat mostly of grass and plants.

                        Flowers did not always exist; they first appeared 140 million years ago....
                        Several centuries ago in Holland, tulips were more valuable than gold.
                        Broccoli is actually a flower.
                        Some plants such as orchids do not need soil to grow-they get all of their nutrients from the air.

                        Birds have feathers, wings, lay eggs and are warm blooded.
                        There are around 10000 different species of birds worldwide.
                        The Ostrich is the largest bird in the world....
                        Scientists believe that birds evolved from theropod dinosaurs.
                        Birds have hollow bones which help them fly.
